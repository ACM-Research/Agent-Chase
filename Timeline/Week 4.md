# Week 4: Unity

Last week, I asked you all to investigate what parameters you may need to know for the reinforcement learning algorithm, and to see how ML Agents in Unity can aid you with this. Today, we will apply this knowledge and start using ML Agents

## Homework
* Finish constructing the world and characters
* Find out how the required parameters are encoded in Unity
