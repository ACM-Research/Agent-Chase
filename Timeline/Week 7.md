# Debugging + Training

Continue to experiment and debug the reinforcement learning algorithm. This is a process; remember how long it takes to train these things! I suggest leaving them on overnight so they can train up. 

# Poster + Presentation
Start coming up with ideas for the presentation. If you want to coordinate outfits (people love this stuff), do that. I suggest making the slides and presentation very entertaining; part of the fun of the Symposium is that even though you're in front of professors and industry judges, you get to treat it a little like a stand-up comedy night.
