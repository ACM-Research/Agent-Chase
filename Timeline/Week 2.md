# Week 2: Introduction to Agent Chase
This week, we get more familiar with the game we are trying to create, as well as the technology we will be using. 

## Meeting
During the meeting, we will go over the Unity platform. We will be using Unity's ML Agents extension to help us with our game creation. We will first install Python and Anaconda. Then, we will install Unity and add the ML Agents extension via Anaconda.

## Homework
* Create a basic 2D world bounded by four walls.
* Create a character that can move in 8 directions, can accelerate to a top speed, and is affected by friction.
* Create goal areas that respawn when characters touch them.

This is a lot of homework! Make sure to split this up and collaborate; you will struggle much more than you need to if you don't.
