# Week 1: Setup
This week, we will be introducing ourselves and getting to know one another with some icebreakers, along with meeting the rest of the teams. I do intend for ACM Research to be a social group, because you will be working with one another for over three months :)

## Meeting
### Icebreakers

### Github Introduction
We will be learning how to use Git and GitHub. GitHub will be where our project is hosted, and it is the most common way to collaborate on coding projects. It's also great for showcasing your work, so get comfortable with it!

### VS Code Installation
We will quickly go through VS Code features. We can try to get this installed, in which case we will walk through integrating Git and GitHub into VS Code for easy access.

## Homework
We will try to schedule a meeting with our faculty advisor. The project that we are attempting to take on is quite a massive one, especially if you haven't really coded before, so your faculty advisor will be a huge blessing to you when working on this research project.
