# Week 9

## Presentation Script
If a script hasn't been built yet, now is the time to finish writing the script. We will start intensively practicing this week. Our goal is to memorize the presentation so that when we present, it seems fluid and natural.

## Poster Information
Please make the poster interesting. Don't make it look generic monotone orange like almost every other poster other years.

## Model Training (Continued)
Try to record a demo here while you can. If you think a live demonstration is possible, then try it.
