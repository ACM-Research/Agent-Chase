# Finalizing Parameters
By now, we should have worked out the kinks in the Unity environment, and the algorithm should (hopefully) be functioning nicely on well-constructed characters and worlds. 

## Presentation
With less than a month left until Symposium Night, it's time to start working on it and the poster. Choose a software to present the slides on. Google Slides is always there if you want familiarity, but there are other apps (Pitch being a well-loved one among Projects and Research participants). In addition, start thinking about how the final demo is going to go. Is it going to be pre-recorded? Is it going to be live? This is for you to decide based on how you think the model is going and how you are faring with Unity.
