# Week 3: Which Method?

There are two major ideas we can use for the algorithm, those being reinforcement learning or a genetic algorithm. This week, we will look over both ideas, evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of both, and choose an approach to look through.

## Reinforcement Learning

## Genetic Algorithm


## Homework
Depending on which method we select, start searching up potential parameters for the agents. For example, start quantifying position of the agents, velocities, position of the goal, walls, and directional sensors. (A lot of this is handled with Unity ML Agents - make sure to see how you can implement these parameters with it!)
