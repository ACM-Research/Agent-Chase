# Pre-Break

## Objectives for Break:
1. Try to run the world. See how fast it executes - if it's slow, then we'll need time to see if we can speed things up. We also need time to mess around with parameters like the agent state, goalie delay, etc. so we need to see how this executes.
2. Attempt to implement the reinforcement learning algorithm. This is the most challenging part, and I expect that most of this week and break week (as well as weeks afterward) will be focused on executing this algorithm. This may take a lot of time, and I mean a LOT. Expect millions of iterations before things start happening, and many failed attempts. This is why we start early and break things during spring break!
3. If by some miracle everything gets figured out, I want you to be able to save certain agents at steps 0, 10000, 20000, etc. so we can replay them later and see what happens.
