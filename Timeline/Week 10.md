# Week 10: The Grind

At this point, we should be finalizing things. The model should be completed and trained, and the poster outline should be finished. By now, you should have had the following things done:

(make this bullet pointed idk how to do this in markdown yet)
1. A script should be finalized or close to finalized.
2. If you decide to match outfits for the presentation (which I highly recommend you do), they should be ordered by now.
3. Record a demonstration in Unity and have it ready to go on your slide deck.
4. The slides should have most of their content filled out.
