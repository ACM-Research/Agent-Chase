# Welcome Back from Spring Break!
We've reached the halfway point of this program. By this time the agents should have been set up.

Since we've reached the halfway point, it's time to start thinking about what we will be showcasing to everyone at the Symposium. 

## Poster
The first object you will be presenting is the poster.

[ design templates ] 
[ LaTeX/Overleaf? ]

## Presentation
During the Symposium, you will be giving a presentation with a slide deck in front of a LOT of people, including professors and judges. It's time to start thinking about what you will be putting on the presentation slides. Here are some ideas:

### Demo
One feature that started with ACM Projects but is slowly making its way to research is the demonstration of the final project. Our goal should be able to create a fully functional demo of our project that we can see over time. There are two approaches:

#### Live Demo
This is the harder but more jaw-dropping option. It's what it sounds like; we hook the computer up live and show how the agents behave in real time.

#### Pre-recorded Demo
This is the safer, more controllable option. This option allows us more breathing space and a cleaner presentation.
