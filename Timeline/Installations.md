Unity offers a student plan, allowing you access to professional tools. We probably won't need these, but just for funsies:

Once you finish those, there are a couple of tutorials in Unity that you can follow. Some of you (or all of you) already have quite a bit of experience in Unity, so this might not be as needed. If you aren't familiar with Unity, I highly recommend you do those introductory tutorials. Once you finish those, we can go to ML-Agents.

Potential Issues:
* If executing the "mlagents-learn --help" command throws an error, try updating the package "protobuf" with the following command: pip install protobuf~=3.20.0
* This should be done in a virtual environment for Python. Not doing so can cause issues with ML-Agents.
* Make sure you install PyTorch in the virtual environment as well.
* If you haven't installed Visual Studio (not VS Code, Visual Studio), you might need the C++ 
* Will be updated as I find other potential problems
